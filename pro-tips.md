# Pro Tips 
## (i.e. What Our Most Successful Students in the Past Have Done)

- Ask questions CONSTANTLY (during lectures and labs, via Slack after class hours, etc.)
- Work on homework with TAs & other students after class to reinforce learning
- Don't stay stuck – Slack fellow students, TAs, & instructors for help or look at provided solutions as needed
- Raise a red flag as soon as you feel yourself falling behind – we can better support you if you are 1 day behind, vs. 1 week
