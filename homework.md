## Thurs, March 15
- Write a function that counts how many 0s there are in an array: 
	- ex: `countZeros([0, 2, 0, 6, 4, 0]) // => 3`
- Write a function that counts how many vowels there are in an array:
	- ex: `countVowels([0, 2, 0, 6, 4, 0]) // => 3`
	- Hint: declare a `var vowels = [‘a’, ‘e’, ‘I, ‘o’, ‘u’]` variable
	- Hint: use JavaScript’s `.indexOf()` function to test if a letter is in that `vowels` array (look up what `.indexOf()` does if you are not sure!)

- Write a function that formats an object (with `name`, `age`, and `city` keys) into a sentence
    - ex. `getPersonSentence({name: ’Sam’, age: 28, city: 'Los Angeles'}) // => 'Sam is 28 years old and lives in Los Angeles'`
- Write a function that formats an object (with `name`, `yearOfBirth`, and `city` keys) into a sentence
    - ex. `getPersonSentence({name: ’Sam’, yearOfBirth: 1990, city: 'Los Angeles'}) // => 'Sam is 28 years old and lives in Los Angeles'`

- Write a function that takes in an array of objects (with `name` and `age` keys), and prints out each object’s name
    - ex: `getNames([{name: ’Sam’, age: 20}, {name: ’Charlotte’, age: 30}, {name: ’Dany’, age: 40}]) => [‘Sam’, ‘Charlotte’, ‘Dany’]`
- Write a function that takes in an array of objects (with `name` and `age` keys), and prints out the longest name
    - ex: `getLongestName([{name: ’Sam’, age: 20}, {name: ’Charlotte’, age: 30}, {name: ’Dany’, age: 40}]) => ‘Charlotte’`
    - Hint: Use the previously written `getNames()` function to help you

- Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a sentence with the highest number, lowest number, and the difference between them
    - ex: `getDifference([5, 2, 3, 8, 1]) // => 'The highest number is 8. The lowest number is 1. The difference is 7'`

## Wed, March 14
- Continue working on Personal Portfolio
  - Spend most of your time styling
  - Make sure you are hitting all [requirements](https://github.com/sf-wdi-44/personal-portfolio#deliverables)
  - Some helpful examples of portfolio pages [here](https://jkwr.github.io/), [here](https://conmart.github.io/), and [here](https://supertrunkes.github.io/)
- Finish Kyrel, Part II
- Finish JS Basics Problem Set
- *BONUS:* Finish JS Objects training lab
- *BONUS:* 
  - Write a function called `fizzbuzz` that takes in an array of numbers as an argument and 
    - returns the word 'fizz' for each number in the array that is divisible by 3
    - returns the word 'buzz' for each number in the array that is divisible by 5
    - returns the word 'fizzbuzz' for each number in the array that is divisible by both 3 and 5
  - Write a function called `calculator` that takes in 2 numbers and a mathematical operation as a string (i.e. 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide') and
    - returns the sum of the 2 numbers if the operation is 'add'
    - returns the difference if the operation is 'subtract'
    - returns the product if the operation is 'multiply'
    - returns the quotient if the operation is 'divide'

## Tues, March 13
- Finish Training: JavaScript Data Types
- Finish JS Control Flow training lab – *Submit the Github URL for your JS Control Flow lab in Project Submission Doc*
- Finish Personal Portfolio (Part I) project – *Submit the Github URL for your Personal Portfolio project in Project Submission Doc* (you will be having a feedback session with an instructor on your progress this Friday)
- *BONUS:* Write some code that has 2 variables: `let dividend = 21;` and `let divider = 4;`. Your code should divide the `dividend` by the `divider` and `console.log` a sentence that looks like this: `21 divided by 4 equals 5, with a remainder of 1!`. (Think of the modulus in JavaScript!)
