# Week 3: Full-Stack JavaScript

## December 14, Thursday
1. Fill out the weekly pulse check. Link in Slack.
2. Finish Sprint 2 of Tunely. In the morning, you'll have a new partner, and everyone will start the beginning of sprint 3 together. (If you don't have time to finish writing all of the code yourself, you should read through the directions for Sprints 1/2 so you know what's happened when you start tomorrow.)

## December 13, Wednesday
1. Review what [referenced data](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/mongoose-associations#implementation-referenced) is and how it works in Mongo.
2. Finish Sprints 1-2 of the [Book App](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/mongoose-books-app). Use POSTMAN to verify all API endpoints!
3. BONUS: Read the `seed.js` file in your Book App and reason about what the code is accomplishing.

## December 12, Tuesday
1. Continue working on the Todo App v2 that we started today in class. There are solutions for each of the methods in the [README file](https://github.com/SF-WDI-42/mongoose), but try to get through as many as possible without reading through those solutions!
2. Walk back through all the code that we wrote today, and try to break it down to the level that we did in class ("when a get request comes to this url, we look in the database... " etc.). This type of understanding is the most useful tool to have so that you can use your previous code to help you in the days/weeks to come.

## December 11, Monday
1. Review comments on your Personal AJAX Project (PR links were Slacked out). Address comments by adding commits to your repo (NOT merging in the PR).
2. Get as far as possible on the Test-Driven To Do App. Try to at least get through the index, show, and create methods.

# Week 2: JavaScript on the Web
## December 8, Friday
1. Your job this weekend is to explore a new API. You get two options for this. Whichever option you choose, **put a link to your repo into the Project Submission doc**, and consider turning on GitHub Pages in your repo settings as well.
  * Pick any API **that does not require OAuth** from [this list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). Build a site that uses that API based on user input. (So your site needs to allow a user to enter some information, then make an AJAX request using the information they entered.)
  * Complete the [Spotify search lab](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/spotify-search-lab), which is a specific set of requirements with the Spotify API.

## December 7, Thursday
1. Finish the Giffaw lab begun in class.
2. Get started on the <a href="https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/geoquakes">Geoquakes Project</a>. Your job is to finish **Parts 1 and 2** of that lab, which are very similar to Giffaw. We will work on parts 3 and 4 in class tomorrow.

## December 6, Wednesday
1. Sign up for an account at [http://git.generalassemb.ly](http://git.generalassemb.ly). (I know you already have a GitHub account. This is different.) Add your username to the project submission doc.
2. Finish the [Racing Game Project](https://github.com/sf-wdi-40/project-0), and add a link in the project submission doc. In the morning, we'll present these science-fair style: you'll show your game on your computer and walk around to play others' games as well.
3. BONUS: Spend time reviewing JavaScript practice problems from last week, especially [JS Basics Problems Set](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/problem-set-js-basics) & [Objects](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/js-objects-training).

## Dec 5, Tuesday
1. Finish [DOM Events Lab](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/jquery-events-lab)
2. Finish [Tic Tac Toe Project](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/tic-tac-toe)

## Dec 4, Monday
1. Finish [Functions Training](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/functions-exercises)
2. Do [Laundry Lab](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/js-iterators-laundry-lab)

# Week 1: Welcome to WDI!

## Dec 1, Friday
1. Finish the <a href="https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/personal-portfolio/blob/master/part-2.md">Portfolio Part 2</a> assignment. To do a code review Monday morning, **we will print your code at 8:00am Monday**, so you MUST put links in the Project Submission doc before then.
2. Re-visit any earlier assignments or topics you'd like to review. Recommended topics:
  - BASICS REVIEW: Be able to answer all questions covered in the Fundamentals assessment packet
  - JS WARM-UP: [Data Types](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/js-data-types-training), [Control Flow](https://github.com/sf-wdi-labs/js-control-flow-training/), & [Objects](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/js-objects-training)
  - JS PRACTICE: [Problems Set](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/problem-set-js-basics) & [jQuery Playground](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/jquery-playground-lab)
  - BOOTSTRAP: Implement different Bootstrap [components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) into your Personal Portfolio
