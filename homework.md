# Week 3: 
## December 11, Monday
1. Review comments on your Personal AJAX Project (PR links were Slacked out).
2. Finish [Test-Driven To Do App](https://github.com/sf-wdi-labs/test-driven-todo-api).

# Week 2: JavaScript on the Web
## December 8, Friday
1. Your job this weekend is to explore a new API. You get two options for this. Whichever option you choose, **put a link to your repo into the Project Submission doc**, and consider turning on GitHub Pages in your repo settings as well.
  * Pick any API **that does not require OAuth** from [this list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). Build a site that uses that API based on user input. (So your site needs to allow a user to enter some information, then make an AJAX request using the information they entered.)
  * Complete the [Spotify search lab](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/spotify-search-lab), which is a specific set of requirements with the Spotify API.

## December 7, Thursday
1. Finish the Giffaw lab begun in class.
2. Get started on the <a href="https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/geoquakes">Geoquakes Project</a>. Your job is to finish **Parts 1 and 2** of that lab, which are very similar to Giffaw. We will work on parts 3 and 4 in class tomorrow.

## December 6, Wednesday
1. Sign up for an account at [http://git.generalassemb.ly](http://git.generalassemb.ly). (I know you already have a GitHub account. This is different.) Add your username to the project submission doc.
2. Finish the [Racing Game Project](https://github.com/sf-wdi-40/project-0), and add a link in the project submission doc. In the morning, we'll present these science-fair style: you'll show your game on your computer and walk around to play others' games as well.
3. BONUS: Spend time reviewing JavaScript practice problems from last week, especially [JS Basics Problems Set](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/problem-set-js-basics) & [Objects](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/js-objects-training).

## Dec 1, Friday
